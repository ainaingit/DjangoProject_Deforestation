Project: Real-Time Deforestation Tracking via Satellite Imagery üåçüå≥
This project aims to develop a real-time deforestation monitoring application using satellite imagery to track changes in forest cover over time. By comparing past and current images, the system identifies and visualizes deforestation activities, offering a powerful tool for understanding environmental changes and supporting conservation efforts.

Key Features:
Real-Time Deforestation Tracking: Uses satellite imagery to monitor and analyze deforestation over time, comparing historical and current images to detect changes in forest cover.

Before and After Imagery: Displays side-by-side comparisons of images from different time periods to visualize the extent of deforestation.

Interactive Map: Allows users to explore regions affected by deforestation through an interactive map, showing real-time changes and historical data.

Deforestation Alerts: Automatic alerts to notify users when new deforestation zones are detected based on image comparisons.

Cause and Impact Analysis: Identifies and visualizes the potential causes of deforestation, such as illegal logging, agriculture, and urban expansion.

Conservation Efforts Tracking: Integrates data on ongoing conservation projects to assess their effectiveness in countering deforestation.

Technologies Used:
Backend: Python (Flask/Django)

Database: PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geospatial data

Frontend: React.js or Vue.js for the user interface

Satellite Imagery Analysis: Google Earth Engine, Sentinel Hub, or other satellite data APIs

Geospatial Tools: QGIS for image processing and comparison

Mapping: Leaflet.js, Mapbox

API: RESTful API for real-time image and deforestation data access

Project Goals:
Provide an accessible platform for real-time monitoring and analysis of deforestation using satellite images.

Enable users to compare "before" and "after" imagery to assess the impact of deforestation over time.

Support environmental organizations, governments, and researchers in tracking deforestation trends and implementing targeted conservation efforts.

Raise awareness about deforestation and its long-term effects on ecosystems, biodiversity, and climate change.
